Lets build a simple data collector application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

1. We should have 3 fields in the form.
2. Under that there should be a button.
3. We should have the table to display the info that is taken from the form.
4. On clicking the button in form, the information entered in the form should be displayed in the table.
   And the form must have been cleared.
