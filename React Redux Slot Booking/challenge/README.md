There should be a ball icon on the header which should navigate to the home page
When today's date is selected, it should display 'Booking has been closed.Book your slot for [tomorrow's date]'
When the next day is selected, the slots should be displayed along with the 'Book Now' button and input fields to get the name and contact number
When a future date is selected, it should display 'Booking is not opened yet'
On clicking 'Book Now', slots must be booked with an alert message displaying the booking ID.
---Slot Color Code
Slots should be differentiated with three colors, as follows:
Green - Available slot
Blue - Selected slot
Red - Booked slot
---Search Page
